## Explaining page__container

Page container is our principal block of our app. 

* Block: page
* Element: page__container

And after that we create the class: "container" and from there we create other elements from it: "container___header", and "container__newsletter".

## grid or grid--small?

In this case we do not have other grid elements that are being used, only one.
But in the case we've had more than one, the modifier "grid--small" would be used.

Same applies for input--small

## Other modifiers

* button--input 

This is the case where we are using a primary button but as it is placed in our 
form newsletter, there should be a modifier to maybegive it a border radius that matchs the 
sign up form.
